# Gender-Identification-By-Formants

Gender Identification by Formants:
It has been observed that male and female speakers produce different range of
formant frequencies while generating vowel sounds. Therefore vowel sounds may
be used to differentiate if the speaker is male or female. Your goal is go through a
sequence of audio clips in which the speaker has produce the vowel sounds and
identify if the speaker is male or female.
The threshold frequency for 1st formant for the distinction of Male and Female
Is 255Hz. If the first formant is less than 255Hz than the Subject is Male and
similarly if the first formant frequency is greater than 255Hz the subject is Female.
